Monorepo Architecture Proof of Concept
A modern monorepo web application demonstrating scalable architecture patterns with independent packages, shared utilities, and comprehensive Docker orchestration.

🏗️ Architecture Overview
This project showcases a production-ready monorepo structure with three core packages:

@poc/client - React frontend with Vite build system
@poc/server - Express.js API backend with TypeScript
@poc/core - Shared utilities, types, and common functionality

🚀 Quick Start
Prerequisites
Node.js 20+
Docker & Docker Compose
npm 9+
Development Setup
Clone and install dependencies:

git clone <repository-url>
cd monorepo-poc
npm install
Start development servers:

npm run dev
Access the application:

Frontend: http://localhost:3000
Backend API: http://localhost:3001
Docker Development
Start all services in development mode:

docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
Build and start production containers:

docker-compose up --build
Access via reverse proxy:

Application: http://localhost
API: http://localhost/api
🐳 Docker Orchestration
Service Architecture

Container Services
Service	Port	Purpose	Health Check
nginx	80, 443	Reverse proxy & load balancer	/health
client	3000 → 80	React frontend application	HTTP response
server	3001	Express.js API backend	/api/health
core	N/A	Shared utilities library	Build status
Docker Commands
# Development workflow
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# Production deployment
docker-compose up -d

# Scale specific services
docker-compose up --scale server=3

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f server

# Rebuild and restart
docker-compose up --build --force-recreate

# Clean up
docker-compose down -v --remove-orphans
🛠️ Development Workflow
NPM Workspace Commands
# Install dependencies for all packages
npm install

# Run development servers for all packages
npm run dev

# Build all packages for production
npm run build

# Test all packages
npm run test

# Work with specific packages
npm run dev --workspace=@poc/client
npm run build --workspace=@poc/server
npm run test --workspace=@poc/core
Package-Specific Development
# Client development
cd packages/client
npm run dev

# Server development
cd packages/server
npm run dev

# Core library development
cd packages/core
npm run dev
📁 Package Details
@poc/client
Technologies: React 18, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

Features:

Modern React hooks and components
GitHub-inspired UI design
Interactive monorepo visualization
Hot module replacement in development
Optimized production builds with Nginx
Docker Features:

Multi-stage build for optimized production image
Nginx reverse proxy with compression
Static asset caching and security headers
@poc/server
Technologies: Express.js, TypeScript, CORS

Features:

RESTful API endpoints
Shared utility integration
Environment-based configuration
Health check endpoints
Production-ready error handling
Docker Features:

Non-root user security
Health checks for container orchestration
Environment variable configuration

@poc/core
Technologies: TypeScript, ES6 Modules

Features:

Shared type definitions
Common utility functions
API response formatting
Request validation helpers
Cross-package compatibility
Docker Features:

Lightweight build container
Shared volume for package distribution
Build artifact optimization
🔧 Configuration
Environment Variables
Copy .env.example to .env and configure:

# Server Configuration
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3001

# Client Configuration
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001

# Docker Configuration
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=monorepo-poc
Nginx Configuration
The reverse proxy provides:

Rate limiting (10 req/s for API, 50 req/s for static)
Security headers (XSS protection, content type validation)
GZIP compression
Static asset caching
Health check endpoints
🚢 Deployment
Production Deployment
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Check service health
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs

# Scale backend services
docker-compose up --scale server=3 -d
CI/CD Integration
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
name: Build and Deploy
on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Build images
        run: docker-compose build
      - name: Run tests
        run: docker-compose run --rm server npm test
      - name: Deploy
        run: docker-compose up -d
🔍 Monitoring & Health Checks
Health Endpoints
Application Health: GET /health
API Health: GET /api/health
Service Status: GET /api/packages
Container Health Checks
# Check container health
docker-compose ps

# View health check logs
docker inspect poc-server | grep -A 10 "Health"

# Manual health check
curl http://localhost/api/health
