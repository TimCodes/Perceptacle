Hi please create a front end only react app for creating and managing system diagrams for google cloud componets. You can you FloWise ( https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise)  and N8N ( https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n ) as example applications. You should usethe React Flow and Chara UI libraries. 

**I. Front-End Requirements Breakdown**

**A. Core Functionality:**

1.  **Diagram Canvas:**

-   **Interactive Canvas:** A space where users can visually build their diagrams using Nodes
-   **Drop Down menu** A drop down menu with the list of node components that is searchable and dragable.
-   **Drag and Drop:** Ability to drag component nodes from a library onto the canvas.
-   **Panning and Zooming:** Smooth panning across large diagrams and zooming in/out.
-   **Connection Drawing:** Ability to draw lines/arrows between components to represent connections/flows.
-   **Selection:** Ability to select individual or multiple components/connections.
-   **Context Menus:** Display relevant context menu options based on selected component (e.g. delete, duplicate).
-   **Grid System:** A visual grid for easier alignment of the components (optional)

3.  **Component Library:**

-   **Categorized Components:** A library of Google Cloud icons, organized by category (e.g., Compute, Storage, Database).
-   **Search/Filter:** Ability to search for specific components by name.
-   **Drag Handles:** Clear drag handles on components to initiate drag and drop.
-   **Visual Previews:** Display appropriate icons or previews of components in the library.

5.  **Component Configuration Panel:**

-   **Basic Property Inputs:** Input fields for setting names, labels, and basic configuration settings for components.
-   **Real-Time Updates:** Changes in properties reflected immediately on the canvas.
-   **Validation:** Basic validation on the property inputs.
-   **Dynamic Inputs:** Dynamically show/hide specific config fields based on the selected components

7.  **Diagram Management:**

-   **New Diagram Button:** Ability to clear the current canvas
-   **Save Button:** Save the current diagram to either browser local storage or an API endpoint.
-   **Load Button:** Load a previously saved diagram from local storage or API.
-   **List of Diagrams:** Displays all the previously saved diagram and allows loading and deleting.

11.  **Search and Filtering:**

-   **Search bar:** Allow to search for existing diagram and components
-   **Filtering options:** Allow to filter based on attributes

**B. Non-Functional Requirements:**

1.  **Performance:**

-   **Smooth Interactions:** The diagram canvas interactions (drag, pan, zoom) should be smooth and responsive.
-   **Efficient Rendering:** Optimize rendering of components on the canvas.

3.  **Usability:**

-   **Intuitive Interface:** Simple and intuitive for users to quickly understand how to create diagrams.
-   **Clear Visuals:** Components, connections, and UI elements should be visually clear.
-   **Accessibility:** Should be somewhat accessible for screen readers, with clear labeling for each control.

5.  **Browser Compatibility:** Should be compatible with modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
6.  **Responsiveness**: The application should be responsive for different screen sizes.

**II. Front-End Development Steps:**

1.  **Technology Stack Setup:**

-   **Framework:**  React
-   **State Management:** React Hooks
-   **UI Component Library:** Chakra UI.
-   **Diagramming Library:** React Flow

3.  **Component Design:**

-   **Canvas Component:** Build the core canvas component, where we would implement the panning, zooming, selecting components, adding components etc.
-   **Component Library:** Create the component that renders the component library, and can fetch the google cloud service icons.
-   **Component Config Panel:** Build the config panel, which displays dynamically based on the selected component.
-   **Diagram Management Panel:** Create the component to display the list of the diagram and handle saving, loading, and deleting diagrams.
-   **Authentication Components:** Create basic login and signup forms.

5.  **State Management Implementation:**

-   Set up actions and reducers to manage the application state, such as:

-   Diagram canvas state (components, connections, zoom level, selected element).
-   Available components.
-   Component configuration data.
-   User authentication state.
-   Diagram Data

7.  **API handling**

-   Create a utility for making API calls, and decide on the data structure for incoming and outgoing data.

9.  **Develop Components and features:**

-   Develop components individually, starting with the core functionality.

-   Implement the ability to add the components to the canvas.
-   Implement drawing connections between components.
-   Implement setting and modifying the configuration for components.

-   Implement diagram saving and loading functionalities.
-   Implement user login and signup.
-   Add search and filtering capabilities.

11.  **Layout Implementation:**

-   Create the desired UI layout for the application, with clear divisions for canvas, component library, component config panel etc.
-   Make the application responsive for mobile and tablet screens.

13.  **Testing:**

-   Unit test components
-   End to end test major functionalities.
-   Perform manual testing for all the UI functionalities.

15.  **Optimization:**

-   Optimize for smooth performance and responsiveness.
-   Optimize the rendering of the application for components and connectio
